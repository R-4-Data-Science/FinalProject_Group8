Description: This package provides a solution for logistic regression using numerical optimization, distinct from pre-existing functions in R. It calculates the coefficient vector (beta) based on a logistic formula, beginning with initial values derived from the least-squares method. It can also generate bootstrap confidence intervals with user-defined parameters, plot the logistic curve, and create a confusion matrix with various predictive metrics, while enabling visualization of these metrics over a range of cut-off values.
