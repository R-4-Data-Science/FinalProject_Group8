# Don't include any code

#Having saved this file within the main folder of your package, you can compile this document using the pkgdown package (this can be installed by executing the following command in your console: devtools::install_github("hadley/pkgdown")). When the latter package is installed and loaded, all you need to do is execute the command pkgdown::build_site() to obtain the following web-page:

# Follow all steps in section 8.1

# Only include descriptions of functions that user will use.
